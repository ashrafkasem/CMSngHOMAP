# CMSngHOMAP
A simple script to transfer CMS's VME HO detailed fiber allocation into uTCA map 

you need to install pandas >= 0.24, openpyxl and xlrd >= 1.0.0  if they are not installed by using 

pandas is fine in lxplus7 and then you can install the rest 

``` 
pip install openpyxl --user
pip install xlrd --user
```

`--user` option you can use if you don't have the privileges to install for example on `lxplus`
